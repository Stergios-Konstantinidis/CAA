## Project Goals:
Establish a system that evalates the alcohol level in someones body. 
By relating it to their alcohol consumption preference (None, be able to drive or no limit) and their departure time, we can make sone drink recommendations.

## How it works:
We are utilizing two m5 Stacks with an RFID reader and a TV0C reader.
The RFID reader allows us to identify the user on our database (through their student card, or any RFID capable card) and the TV0C reader allows us to evaluate their current alcohol level.

We are also using a computer that runs a PyQT page where users can update their informations such as their consumption preference (None, be able to drive or no limit) or weight (usefull in order to evaluate the amount of liters of blood per individual and then the Alcohol mg/L).

Finaly we have a Colaboratory page runing an infinite loop with the function running the user identification; evaluates their alcohol level and finaly recommends drinks.

## Analytics:
1. Current alcohol level 1: We have a standard function that evaluates the alcohol level based on the TVOC sensor (through a Linear Regression fit from data where we had both the TVOC value and the true value
2. Current alcohol level 2: We have a function that evaluates the alcohol level the user should have according to the drink he drank from our system. 
3. Ultimately the maximal value between the current alcohol level 1 and the current alcohol level 2 is kept. That is not as much as for analytics as to ensure that no one would get overly affected by alcohol due to one of the metrics being wrong.
4. Reccomendation : Gives drinks recommendations based on how much alcohol a user can still consume, considering his
current alcohol level, the legal limit 0.25 mg/L and the time he would like to leave and start to drive. The
function will recommend 3 different beverage:
• The most widely served alcoholic drink
• A randomly selected alcoholic beverage
• The most widely served non-alcoholic drink

5. Post event analytics for the bar #Michaela could you write this part? We can then make the analytics or if you have time you can dig into it
